        <h2>Description:</h2>
        <p>This processor monitors its point in the dataflow for
            activity and sends a notice when there is a lack of data flowing
            through it for some user-specified amount of time; it then sends
            another notice when the flow of data resumes.</p>

        <p>In the list below, the names of required properties appear
            in bold. Any other properties (not in bold) are considered optional.
            If a property has a default value, it is indicated. If a property
            supports the use of the NiFi Expression Language (or simply,
            "expression language"), that is also indicated.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Threshold Duration</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>The amount of time that must elapse before the flow is
                        considered inactive.</li>
                    <li>Default value: 5 min</li>

                        period elapses until activity is restored. If false, the processor
                        will send a notice only when the flow first becomes inactive.</li>
