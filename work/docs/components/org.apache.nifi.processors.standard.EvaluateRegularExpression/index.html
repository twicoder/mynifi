        <h2>Description:</h2>
        <p>
            This processor evaluates one or more Regular Expressions against the content of a FlowFile.
            The results of those Regular Expressions are assigned to FlowFile Attributes.
            Regular Expressions are entered by adding user-defined properties;
            the name of the property maps to the Attribute Name into which the result will be placed.
            The value of the property must be a valid Regular Expressions with exactly one capturing group.
            If the Regular Expression matches more than once, only the first match will be used.
            If any provided Regular Expression matches, the FlowFile(s) will be routed to 'matched'.
            If no provided Regular Expression matches, the FlowFile will be routed to 'unmatched' and no attributes will be applied to the FlowFile.

        <p>
            <strong>Properties:</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            In the list below, the names of required properties appear in bold.
            Any other properties (not in bold) are considered optional. If a
            property has a default value, it is indicated. If a property
            supports the use of the NiFi Expression Language (or simply,
            "expression language"), that is also indicated.
        </p>
