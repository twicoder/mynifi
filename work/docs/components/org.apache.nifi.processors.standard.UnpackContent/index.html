        <h2>Description:</h2>
        <p>This processor unpacks the content of FlowFiles that have
            been packaged with one of several different packaging formats,
            emitting one to many FlowFiles for each input FlowFile.

                        If the &lt;Packaging Format&gt; property is set to <code>use mime.type attribute</code>,
                        this attribute is used to determine the FlowFile's MIME Type. 
                        In this case, if the attribute is set to <code>application/tar</code>, the TAR Packaging Format will be used. 
                        If the attribute is set to <code>application/zip</code>, the ZIP Packaging Format will be used. 
                        If the attribute is set to <code>application/flowfile-v3</code> or <code>application/flowfile-v2</code> or <code>application/flowfile-v1</code>,
                        the appropriate FlowFile Packaging Format will be used.
                        If this attribute is missing, the FlowFile will be routed to 'failure'.
                        Otherwise, if the attribute's value is not one of those mentioned above, the FlowFile will be
                        routed to 'success' without being unpacked.
