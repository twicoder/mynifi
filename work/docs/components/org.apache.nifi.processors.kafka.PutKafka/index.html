        <h2>Description:</h2>
        <p>
        	This Processors puts the contents of a FlowFile to a Topic in 
        	<a href="http://kafka.apache.org/">Apache Kafka</a>. The full contents of
        	a FlowFile becomes the contents of a single message in Kafka.
        	This message is optionally assigned a key by using the
        	&lt;Kafka Key&gt; Property.
        </p>

		<p>
			The Processor allows the user to configure an optional Message Delimiter that
			can be used to send many messages per FlowFile. For example, a \n could be used
			to indicate that the contents of the FlowFile should be used to send one message
			per line of text. If the property is not set, the entire contents of the FlowFile
			will be sent as a single message. When using the delimiter, if some messages are
			successfully sent but other messages fail to send, the FlowFile will be FORKed into
			two child FlowFiles, with the successfully sent messages being routed to 'success'
			and the messages that could not be sent going to 'failure'.
		</p>

        <p>
            <strong>Properties:</strong>
        </p>
        <p>In the list below, the names of required properties appear
            in bold. Any other properties (not in bold) are considered optional.
            If a property has a default value, it is indicated. If a property
            supports the use of the NiFi Expression Language (or simply,
            "expression language"), that is also indicated.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Known Brokers</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                    	A comma-separated list of known Kafka Brokers in the format 
                    	&lt;host&gt;:&lt;port&gt;. This list does not need to be
                    	exhaustive but provides a mechanism for determining which
                    	other nodes belong to the Kafka cluster.
                    </li>
                    <li>Default value: no default</li>
                    <li>Supports expression language: false</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Topic Name</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>The Kafka Topic to send messages to. While the GetKafka
                    	Processor requires a statically named Topic so that it knows
                    	where to fetch messages from, the PutKafka Processor does allow
                    	the Expression Language to be used so that a single PutKafka
                    	Processor can be used to send messages to many different Kafka
                    	topics.
                    </li>
                    <li>Default value: no default</li>
                    <li>Supports expression language: true</li>
                </ul>

            <li>Kafka Key
                <ul>
                    <li>
                    	The Key to use for the Message. If no value is given, the message
                    	will not be given a Key.
                    </li>
                    <li>Default value: no default</li>

            </li>
            <li><strong>Delivery Guarantee</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                    	Specifies the requirement for guaranteeing that a message is sent to Kafka.
                    	This Property can have one of three different values:
                    	<ul>
                    		<li>
                    			<b>Guarantee Replicated Delivery</b> - FlowFile will be routed to 
	                    			failure unless the message is replicated to the appropriate number 
	                    			of Kafka Nodes according to the Topic configuration
	                    	</li>
                    		<li>
                    			<b>Guarantee Single Node Delivery</b> - FlowFile will be routed to 
                    				success if the message is received by a single Kafka node, 
                    				whether or not it is replicated. This is faster than 
                    				&lt;Guarantee Replicated Delivery&gt; but can result in data loss 
                    				if a Kafka node crashes
                    		</li>
                    		<li>
                    			<b>Best Effort</b> - FlowFile will be routed to success after successfully 
                    				writing the content to a Kafka node, without waiting for a response. 
                    				This provides the best performance but may result in data loss.

                    	If not specified, the entire content of the FlowFile will be used as a single message.
                    	If specified, the contents of the FlowFile will be split on this delimiter and each section 
						sent as a separate Kafka message.

                <ul>
                    <li>All FlowFiles that are successfully sent to Kafka are routed
