        <h2>Description:</h2>
        <p>
            This processor calculates a hash value for the content of a
            FlowFile and puts the hash value on the FlowFile as an attribute whose
            name is determined by the <strong>Hash Attribute Name</strong>
            property.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Modifies Attributes:</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            This Processor adds an attribute whose value is the result of Hashing the existing FlowFile attributes.
            The name of this attribute is specified by the &lt;Hash Attribute Name&gt; property.
        </p>


        <p>
            <strong>Properties:</strong>
        </p>
        <p>In the list below, the names of required properties appear
            in bold. Any other properties (not in bold) are considered optional.
            If a property has a default value, it is indicated. If a property
            supports the use of the NiFi Expression Language (or simply,
            "expression language"), that is also indicated.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Hash Attribute Name</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>The name of the FlowFile attribute to which the hash value
                        should be written. If the value already exists, it will be
                        overwritten.</li>
                    <li>Default value: hash.value</li>
                    <li>Supports expression language: false</li>
                </ul></li>
            <li><strong>Hash Algorithm</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>The hashing algorithm that should be used to perform the
                        hashing function.</li>
                    <li>Default value: MD5</li>
                    <li>Supports expression language: false</li>
