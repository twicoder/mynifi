        <!-- Processor Documentation ================================================== -->
        <h2>Description:</h2>
        <p>
            This processor writes FlowFiles to the local file system.</p>
        <p>
            <strong>Properties:</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            In the list below, the names of required properties appear in bold. Any other properties (not in bold) are considered optional. If a property has a default value, it is indicated. If a property supports the use of the NiFi Expression Language (or simply, "expression language"), that is also indicated.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Directory</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>The local file path to the location where files should be written.  You may use expression language such as /aa/bb/${path}.</li>
                    <li>Default value: no default</li>
                    <li>Supports expression language: true</li>
                </ul></li>
            <li><strong>Keep Directory Structure</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>A Boolean value (true/false), indicating whether to maintain the file structure and write FlowFiles to subdirectories of the file path defined in the Directory property.
                        <b>Note:</b> This property is maintained for backward compatibility purposes but is considered "Deprecated" and should not be used (value should remain 'false').
                        Rather than using this property, if the goal is to append the FlowFile's path to the <code>/aa/bb directory</code>, for example, the <code>Directory</code> property should
                        instead be set to <code>/aa/bb/${path}</code>.
                    </li>
                    <li>Default value: false</li>
                    <li>Supports expression language: false</li>
                </ul></li>
            <li><strong>Conflict Resolution Strategy</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Indicates what should happen if the processor cannot write a file to the file path defined in the Directory property. This could happen, for example, if a file of the same name already exists in the directory. Valid options can be selected from the drop-down menu and include:
                        <ul>
                            <li>replace</li>
                            <li>ignore</li>
                            <li>fail</li>
                        </ul></li>
                    <li>Default value: fail</li>
                    <li>Supports expression language: false</li>
                </ul></li>
            <li>Maximum File Count
                <ul>
                    <li>The maximum number of files that can exist in the output directory.</li>
                    <li>Default value: no default</li>
                    <li>Supports expression language: false</li>
                </ul></li>
            <li>Last Modified Time
                <ul>
                    <li>Sets the lastModifiedTime on the output file to the value of this attribute.  Format must be yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ssZ.  You may also use expression language such as ${file.lastModifiedTime}.</li>
                    <li>Default value: no default</li>
                    <li>Supports expression language: true</li>
                </ul></li>
            <li>Permissions
                <ul>
                    <li>Sets the read/write/execute permissions on the output file to the value of this attribute.  Format must be either UNIX rwxrwxrwx with a - in place of denied permissions (e.g. rw-r--r--) or an octal number (e.g. 644).  You may also use expression language such as ${file.permissions}.</li>
                    <li>Default value: no default</li>
                    <li>Supports expression language: true</li>
                </ul></li>
            <li>Owner
                <ul>
                    <li>Sets the owner on the output file to the value of this attribute.  You may also use expression language such as ${file.owner}. Normal access rules apply, meaning your system may not let you change file ownership.</li>
                    <li>Default value: no default</li>
                    <li>Supports expression language: true</li>
                </ul></li>
            <li>Group
                <ul>
                    <li>Sets the group on the output file to the value of this attribute.  You may also use expression language such as ${file.group}. Normal access rules apply, meaning your system may not let you change group ownership.</li>
                    <li>Default value: no default</li>
                    <li>Supports expression language: true</li>
                </ul></li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <strong>Relationships:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>failure
                <ul>
                    <li>If something prevents a FlowFile from being written to its destination directory, then it follows this relationship.</li>
                </ul></li>
            <li>success
                <ul>
