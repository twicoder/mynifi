        <h2>Description:</h2>
        <p>This processor obtains FlowFiles from a local directory.  NiFi will need at least read permissions on the files it will pull otherwise it will ignore them.</p>

        <p>In the list below, the names of required properties appear
            in bold. Any other properties (not in bold) are considered optional.
            If a property has a default value, it is indicated. If a property
            supports the use of the NiFi Expression Language (or simply,
            "expression language"), that is also indicated.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Input Directory</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>The input directory from which to pull files.</li>

                <ul>

                        copy of the file in the input directory after retrieving it; this
                        causes the file to be picked up continually and is useful for
                        testing purposes.  If not keeping source file NiFi will need 
                        at least write permissions to the directory it is pulling from
                        otherwise it will ignore the file.</li>

                        followed by a time unit, such as nanos, millis, secs, mins, hrs, days. <b>NOTE:</b> If a directory
                        listing is empty, the processor will yield for the full yield duration and will not poll during that
