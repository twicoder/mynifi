        <h2> Description:</h2>
        <p>This processor executes an external command on the contents of a FlowFile, and creates a new FlowFile with the 
            results of the command.</p>

        <p>In the list below, the names of required properties appear
            in bold. Any other properties (not in bold) are considered optional.
            If a property has a default value, it is indicated. If a property
            supports the use of the NiFi Expression Language (or simply,
            "expression language"), that is also indicated.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Command Path</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Specifies the command to be executed; if just the name of an executable is provided, it must be in the user's
                        environment PATH.</li>
                    <li>Default value: none</li>
                    <li>Supports expression language: true</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Command Arguments
                <ul>
                    <li>The arguments to supply to the executable delimited by the ';' character. Each argument may be an Expression Language 
                        statement.</li>
                    <li>Default value: none</li>
                    <li>Supports expression language: true</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Working Directory
                <ul>
                    <li>The directory to use as the current working directory when executing the command. If the directory does not exist, 
                        then the process's current working directory will be used.</li>
                    <li>Default value: none (which means whatever NiFi's current working directory is...probably the root of the NiFi 
                        installation directory.)</li>
                    <li>Supports expression language: true</li>
