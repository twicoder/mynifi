        <h2>Description:</h2>
        <p>
            This processor attempts to identify the MIME type used for a
            FlowFile. If the MIME type can be identified, an attribute with the
            name
            <code>mime.type</code>
            is added to the FlowFile, and its value is the detected MIME type.
            Some MIME
            types require the processor to read a significant amount of data; for
            these MIME types, their identification is optional. (See the
            properties Identify ZIP and Identify TAR.) The algorithm may have to
            read the entire contents of a file for each type of identification. If
            the MIME Type cannot be determined, its mime.type attribute will be
            set to
            <code>application/octet-stream</code>
            .
        </p>

        <p>The following MIME Types are detected:
        <ul>
            <li>application/gzip</li>
            <li>application/bzip2</li>
            <li>application/flowfile-v3</li>
            <li>application/flowfile-v1 (requires Identify TAR be set to true)</li>
            <li>application/xml</li>
            <li>video/mp4</li>
            <li>video/x-m4v</li>
