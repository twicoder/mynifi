        <!-- Processor Documentation ================================================== -->
        <h2>Description:</h2>
        <p>This processor is used to pull files from HDFS. The files being pulled in MUST be <code>SequenceFile</code> 
            formatted files. The processor creates a flow file for each key/value entry in the ingested <code>SequenceFile</code>. 
            The created flow file's content depends on the value of the optional configuration property <b>FlowFile Content</b>. Currently,
            there are two choices: VALUE ONLY and KEY VALUE PAIR. With the prior, only the <code>SequenceFile</code> value element is 
            written to the flow file contents. With the latter, the <code>SequenceFile</code> key and value are written to the flow file 
            contents as serialized objects; the format is key length (int), key(String), value length(int), value(bytes). The default is
            VALUE ONLY.</p>
        NOTE: This processor loads the entire value entry into memory. While the size limit for a value entry is 2GB, this will cause 
        memory problems if there are too many concurrent tasks and the data being ingested is large.

        <h2>Properties:</h2>
        <p>In the list below, the names of required properties appear in bold. Any other properties (not in bold) are
            considered optional. If a property has a default value, it is indicated. If a property supports the use of the
            NiFi Expression Language (or simply, "expression language"), that is also indicated.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Hadoop Configuration Resources
                <ul>
                    <li>A file or comma separated list of files which contains the Hadoop file system configuration.
                        Without this, Hadoop will search the classpath for a 'core-site.xml' and 'hdfs-site.xml' file or will
                        revert to a default configuration.</li>
                    <li>Default value: none</li>

            <li><strong>FlowFile Content</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Indicate if the content is to be both the key and value of the Sequence File, or just the value.</li>
                    <li>Default value: VALUE ONLY</li>
                </ul>

                </ul></li>
            <li><strong>Recurse Subdirectories</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>A Boolean value (true/false), when true will pull files from subdirectories of the HDFS <em>Directory</em>.
                    </li>

            <li><strong>Keep Source File</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>A Boolean value (true/false), indicates whether to keep (true) or delete (false) the file from HDFS
                        after it has been successfully transferred.</li>
                    <li>Default value: false</li>
                </ul></li>
            <li>File Filter Regex
                <ul>
                    <li>A Java Regular Expression for filtering Filenames; if a filter is supplied then only files whose
                        names match that Regular Expression will be fetched, otherwise all files will be fetched.</li>
                    <li>Default value: none</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Filter Match Name Only</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>A Boolean value (true/false), when true <em>File Filter Regex</em> will match on just the filename,
                        otherwise subdirectory names will be included with filename in the regex comparison.
                    </li>
                    <li>Default value: true</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>The minimum age that a file must be in order to be fetched; any file that is younger than this
                        amount of time (based on last modification time) will be ignored. The value must be a non-negative
                        integer and be followed by a time unit, such as nanos, millis, secs, mins, hrs, days.</li>
                    <li>Default value: 0 sec</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>The maximum age that a file must be in order to be fetched; any file that is older than this amount
                        of time (based on last modification time) will be ignored. The value must be a non-negative integer,
                        followed by a time unit, such as nanos, millis, secs, mins, hrs, days. Cannot be less than 100 millis.</li>

                    <li>Default value: 0 sec</li>
                </ul></li>
