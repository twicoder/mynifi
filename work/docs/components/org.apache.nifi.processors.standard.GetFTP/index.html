                        given directory on the remote system when doing a file listing.
                        This value should not need to be modified in general; however, when
                        polling against a remote system with a significantly large number
                        of files, this value can be critical. Setting this value too high
                        can result in very poor performance, while setting it too low can
                        cause the flow to be slower than usual.</li>

                        files in the order in which they are naturally listed. If false,
                        the order in which to pull files is not defined.</li>
