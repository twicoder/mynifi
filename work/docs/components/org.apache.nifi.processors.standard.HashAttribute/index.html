        <h2> Description:</h2>
        <p>This processor hashes together the key/value pairs of
            several FlowFile attributes and adds the hash as a new attribute. The
            user may add optional properties such that the name of each property
            is the name of a FlowFile attribute to consider and the value of the
            property is a regular expression that, if matched by the attribute
            value, causes that attribute to be used as part of the hash. If the
            regular expression contains a capturing group, only the value of the
            capturing group is used.
        </p>

            <strong>Modifies Attributes:</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            This Processor adds an attribute whose value is the result of Hashing the existing FlowFile attributes.
            The name of this attribute is specified by the &lt;Hash Value Attribute Key&gt; property.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Properties:</strong>
        </p>
        <p>In the list below, the names of required properties appear
            in bold. Any other properties (not in bold) are considered optional.
            If a property has a default value, it is indicated. If a property
            supports the use of the NiFi Expression Language (or simply,
            "expression language"), that is also indicated.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>The name of the FlowFile attribute whose hash value should
                        be stored.</li>
                    <li>Default value: no default</li>

                    <li>If the processor successfully hashes the key/value pairs of
                        the FlowFile, then the FlowFile follows this relationship.</li>

                        hashing the key/value pairs of the FlowFile, then the FlowFile
                        follows this relationship.</li>
