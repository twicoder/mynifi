        <h2>Description:</h2>

        <p>Reporting Task that checks how much Disk Space is
            available in the Content Repository and the FlowFile Repository. When the amount of available disk space drops below a
            specified threshold, this Reporting Task will create a WARNING level log message and create
            a System-Level bulletin to notify the user.</p>

                    <li>The threshold at which a bulletin will be generated to indicate that the disk usage of the Content Repository is of concern.
                        The value must be a percentage (e.g., 80%). If multiple directories are configured for the Content Repository, a warning
                        will be generated for each directory that exceeds the configured limit</li>
