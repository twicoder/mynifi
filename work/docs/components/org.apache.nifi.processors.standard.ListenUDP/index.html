        <!-- Processor Documentation ================================================== -->
        <h2>Description:</h2>
        <p>
            This processor listens for Datagram Packets on a given port and concatenates the contents of 
            those packets together generating FlowFiles roughly as often as the internal buffer fills up or until 
            no more data is currently available.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Properties:</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            In the list below, the names of required properties appear in bold. Any other properties (not in bold) are considered optional. If a property has a default value, it is indicated. If a property supports the use of the NiFi Expression Language (or simply, "expression language"), that is also indicated.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Port</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>The port to listen on for data packets. Must be known by senders of Datagrams. May be a system
                        property or environment variable.</li>
                    <li>Default value: no default</li>
                    <li>Supports expression language: false</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Receive Timeout</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>The time out period when waiting to receive data from the socket. Specify units.</li>
                    <li>Default value: 5 secs</li>
                    <li>Supports expression language: false</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Max Buffer Size</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Determines the size each receive buffer may be. Specify units.</li>
                    <li>Default value: 1 MB</li>
                    <li>Supports expression language: false</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>FlowFile Size Trigger</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Determines the (almost) upper bound size at which a flow file would be generated. A flow file will get made even if 
                        this value isn't reached if there is no more data streaming in and this value may be exceeded by the size of a 
                        single packet. Specify units.</li>
                    <li>Default value: 1 MB </li>
                    <li>Supports expression language: false</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Max size of UDP Buffer</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>The maximum UDP buffer size that should be used. This is a suggestion to the Operating System 
                        to indicate how big the udp socket buffer should be. Specify units.</li>
                    <li>Default value: 1 MB</li>
                    <li>Supports expression language: false</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Receive Buffer Count</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Number of receiving buffers to be used to accept data from the socket. Higher numbers means more 
                        ram is allocated but can allow better throughput.</li>
                    <li>Default value: 4</li>
                    <li>Supports expression language: false</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Channel Reader Interval</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Scheduling interval for each read channel. Specify units.</li>
                    <li>Default value: 50 millisecs</li>
                    <li>Supports expression language: false</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>FlowFiles Per Session</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>The number of flow files per session. Higher number is more efficient, but will lose more data 
                        if a problem occurs that causes a rollback of a session.</li>
                    <li>Default value: 10</li>
                    <li>Supports expression language: false</li>

                    <li>IP, or name, of a remote host. Only Datagrams from the specified Sending Host Port and this host 
                        will be accepted. Improves Performance. May be a system property or an environment variable. If
                        this is specified, the Sending Host Port must be specified as well.</li>

                        and this port will be accepted. Improves Performance. May be a system property or an environment 
                        variable.If this is specified, the Sending Host must be specified as well.</li>
