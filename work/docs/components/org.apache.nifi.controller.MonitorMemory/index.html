        <h2>Description:</h2>

        <p>Reporting Task that checks how much Java Heap Space is
            available after Full Garbage Collections. When the heap exceeds a
            specified threshold immediatley following a Full Garbage Collection,
            this Reporting Task will create a WARNING level log message and create
            a System-Level bulletin to notify the user.</p>

        <p>
            <strong>Properties:</strong>
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Memory Pool</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>The name of the JVM Memory Pool. The allowed values depend
                        on the JVM and operating system. The following values are typically supported:
                        <ul>
                            <li>PS Old Gen</li>
                            <li>PS Survivor Space</li>
                            <li>PS Eden Space</li>
                            <li>PS Perm Gen</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Required: true</li>
                    <li>Default value: (none)</li>
                    <li>Supports expression language: false</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Usage Threshold</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The threshold for memory usage that will cause a notification to occur. The format can either be a percentage (e.g., 80%) or a Data Size (e.g., 1 GB)
                    </li>
                    <li>Required: true</li>
                    <li>Default value: 65%</li>
                    <li>Supports expression language: false</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Reporting Interval</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Indicates how often this reporting task should report bulletins while the memory utilization exceeds the configured threshold.
                        If set, must be a valid time period (e.g., "5 mins")
                    </li>
