        <!-- Processor Documentation ================================================== -->
        <h2>Description:</h2>
        <p>
            This processor evaluates one or more XPaths against the content
            of FlowFiles. The results of those XPaths are assigned to FlowFile
            attributes or are written to the content of the FlowFile itself,
            depending on how the user configures the Destination  and Return Type properties in the
            processor. XPaths are entered by adding user-defined properties; the
            name of each user-added property maps to the attribute name into
            which the result should be placed. The value of the property must be
            a valid XPath expression.
        <p>
            <strong>Properties:</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            In the list below, the names of required properties appear in bold.
            Any other properties (not in bold) are considered optional. If a
            property has a default value, it is indicated. If a property
            supports the use of the NiFi Expression Language (or simply,
            "expression language"), that is also indicated.
        </p>

        </p>
        <p>
            This processor adds user-defined attributes if the &lt;Destination&gt; property is set to
            <code>flowfile-attribute</code>.

                <strong>Destination</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Indicates whether the results of the XPath evaluation are
                        written to the FlowFile content or a FlowFile attribute; if using
                        attribute, the attribute's name must be specified in the value of
                        the Attribute Name property.</li>
                    <li>
                        Valid values are:

                        Selecting 'auto-detect' will set the return type to 'nodeset' for a
                        Destination of 'flowfile-content', and 'string' for a Destination of
                        'flowfile-attribute'.")</li>
