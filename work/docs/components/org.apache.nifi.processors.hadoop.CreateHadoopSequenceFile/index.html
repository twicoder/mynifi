        <!-- Processor Documentation ================================================== -->
        <h2>Description:</h2>
        <p>This processor is used to create a Hadoop Sequence File, which essentially is a file of key/value pairs. The key 
            will be a file name and the value will be the flow file content. The processor will take either a merged (a.k.a. packaged) flow 
            file or a singular flow file. Historically, this processor handled the merging by type and size or time prior to creating a 
            SequenceFile output; it no longer does this. If creating a SequenceFile that contains multiple files of the same type is desired,
            precede this processor with a <code>RouteOnAttribute</code> processor to segregate files of the same type and follow that with a
            <code>MergeContent</code> processor to bundle up files. If the type of files is not important, just use the 
            <code>MergeContent</code> processor. When using the <code>MergeContent</code> processor, the following Merge Formats are 
            supported by this processor:
        <ul>
            <li>TAR</li>
            <li>ZIP</li>
            <li>FlowFileStream v3</li>
        </ul>
        The created SequenceFile is named the same as the incoming FlowFile with the suffix '.sf'. For incoming FlowFiles that are 
        bundled, the keys in the SequenceFile are the individual file names, the values are the contents of each file.
    </p>
    NOTE: The value portion of a key/value pair is loaded into memory. While there is a max size limit of 2GB, this could cause memory
    issues if there are too many concurrent tasks and the flow file sizes are large.

    <h2>Properties:</h2>
    <p>In the list below, the names of required properties appear in bold. Any other properties (not in bold) are
        considered optional. If a property has a default value, it is indicated. If a property supports the use of the
        NiFi Expression Language (or simply, "expression language"), that is also indicated.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Hadoop Configuration Resources
            <ul>
                <li>A file or comma separated list of files which contains the Hadoop file system configuration.
                    Without this, Hadoop will search the classpath for a 'core-site.xml' and 'hdfs-site.xml' file or will
                    revert to a default configuration.</li>
                <li>Default value: none</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>compression type
            <ul>
                <li>Type of compression to use when creating Sequence File.</li>
                <li>Default value: none</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Relationships:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>success
            <ul>
                <li>Generated Sequence Files are sent to this relationship.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>fail
            <ul>
                <li>Incoming files that failed to generate a Sequence File are sent to this relationship.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
