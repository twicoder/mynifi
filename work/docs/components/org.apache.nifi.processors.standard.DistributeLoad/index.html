        <h2>Description:</h2>
        <p>This processor distributes FlowFiles to downstream
            processors based on a distribution strategy. The user may select the strategy "round robin", the
            strategy "next available", or "load distribution service". If using the round robin
            strategy, the default is to assign each destination (i.e., relationship) a weighting of 1
            (evenly distributed). However, the user may add optional properties to change this weighting. When 
            adding a property, the name must be a positive integer between 1 and the number of relationships (inclusive).
            For example, if Number of Relationships has a value of 8 and a property is added with the name 5
            and the value 10, then relationship 5 (among the 8) will receive 10
            FlowFiles in each iteration instead of 1. All other relationships will receive 1 FlowFile in each iteration.
        </p>
        <strong>Properties:</strong>
    </p>
    <p>In the list below, the names of required properties appear
        in bold. Any other properties (not in bold) are considered optional.
        If a property has a default value, it is indicated. If a property
        supports the use of the NiFi Expression Language (or simply,
        "expression language"), that is also indicated.</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Number of Relationships</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>The number of relationships to which the load should be
                    distributed. A valid value is a non-negative integer.</li>
                <li>Default value: 1</li>
                <li>Supports expression language: false</li>
            </ul></li>
        <li><strong>Distribution Strategy</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>This property determines how the load is distributed. If
                    the round robin strategy is used, the processor does not distribute
                    any FlowFiles unless all destinations can accept FlowFiles. If the
                    next available strategy is used, the processor distributes
                    FlowFiles as long as at least one destination can accept FlowFiles.
                    If the load distribution service is used, the processor ignores any
                    user specified optional properties, requires the service id of the
                    Load Distribution Service, and requires a list of fully qualified host
                    names, or FQDN's, which are the distribution end points.
                    Valid values are:
                    <ul>
                        <li>round robin</li>
                        <li>next available</li>
                        <li>load distribution service</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Default value: round robin</li>
                <li>Supports expression language: false</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Hostnames - this is required when using 'load distribution service' strategy
            <ul>
                <li>List of remote servers to distribute across. Each server must be FQDN and use either ',', ';', or 'space' as a delimiter</li>
                <li>Default Value: none</li>
                <li>Supports expression language: false</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Load Distribution Service ID - this is required when using 'load distribution service' strategy
            <ul>
                <li>The identifier of the Load Distribution Service</li>
                <li>Default Value: none</li>
                <li>Supports expression language: false</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        <strong>Relationships:</strong>
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>1
            <ul>
                <li>By default, there is one relationship, named 1. The number
                    of relationships is determined by the value of the &lt;Number of
                    Relationships&gt; property.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
