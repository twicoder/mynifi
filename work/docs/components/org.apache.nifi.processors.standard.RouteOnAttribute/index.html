        <h2>Description:</h2>
        <p>
            This processor routes FlowFiles based on their attributes
            using the NiFi Expression Language. Users add properties with
            valid NiFi Expression Language Expressions as the values. Each Expression must
            return a value of type Boolean (true or false).
        </p>
        <p>
            Example: The goal is to route all files with filenames that start with ABC down a certain path. 
            Add a property with the following name and value:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>property name</strong>: ABC
            </li>
            <li><strong>property value</strong>: ${filename:startsWith('ABC')}
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            In this example, all files with filenames that start with ABC will follow the ABC relationship.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Properties:</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            In the list below, the names of required properties appear
            in bold.
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Routing Strategy</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Specifies how to determine which relationship to use when
                        evaluating the expression language. Options are:
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>Route to Property Name</b> - For each property that has been added, if its Expression evaluates to <code>true</code>
                                for a given FlowFile, that FlowFile will be routed to the Relationship whose name is defined by the property name.
                                If multiple properties' Expressions evaluate to <code>true</code>, a clone of the FlowFile will be created
                                for each relationship.</li>

                            <li><b>Route to 'match' if all match</b> - If all configured Expressions evaluate to <code>true</code>
                                for a given FlowFile, that FlowFile will be routed to 'matched'; otherwise, the FlowFile will be
                                routed to 'unmatched'.</li>

                            <li><b>Route to 'match' if any matches</b> - If any configured Expression evaluates to <code>true</code>
                                for a given FlowFile, that FlowFile will be routed to 'matched'; otherwise, the FlowFile will be
                                routed to 'unmatched'.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Default value: Route to Property Name</li>
                    <li>Supports expression language: false</li>
                </ul></li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            <strong>Relationships:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>matched
                <ul>
                    <li>If the Routing Strategy selected is either Route to 'match'
                        if all match or Route to 'match' if any matches, then this
                        relationship becomes available and FlowFiles meeting those
                        conditions follow this relationship.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>unmatched
                <ul>
                    <li>FlowFiles that do not match any user-defined expression
                        will be routed to this relationship.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>user-added relationships
                <ul>
                    <li>User-added properties result in new relationships; if a
                        FlowFile's attributes match the criteria specified in the
                        user-added properties, then it follows the associated
                        relationship(s).</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
