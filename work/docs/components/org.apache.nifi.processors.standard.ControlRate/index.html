        <!-- Processor Documentation ================================================== -->
        <h2>Description:</h2>
        <p>This processor controls the rate at which data is
            transferred to follow-on processors.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Properties:</strong>
        </p>
        <p>In the list below, the names of required properties appear
            in bold. Any other properties (not in bold) are considered optional.
            If a property has a default value, it is indicated. If a property
            supports the use of the NiFi Expression Language (or simply,
            "expression language"), that is also indicated.</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Rate Control Criteria</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Indicates the criteria used to control the throughput rate.
                        Changing this value resets the rate counters. Possible values are:
                        <ul>
                            <li>data rate</li>
                            <li>flowfile count</li>
                            <li>attribute value</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Default value: data rate</li>
                    <li>Supports expression language: false</li>
                </ul></li>
            <li><strong>Maximum Rate</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>The maximum rate at which data should pass through this
                        processor. The format of this value is expected to be a
                        non-negative integer or, if the Rate Control Criteria is set to
                        data rate, a data size (such as 1MB).</li>
                    <li>Default value: no default</li>
                    <li>Supports expression language: false</li>
                </ul></li>
            <li>Rate Controlled Attribute
                <ul>
                    <li>The name of an attribute whose values build toward the rate
                        limit if the Rate Control Criteria is set to attribute value. The
                        value of the attribute referenced by this property must be a
                        non-negative integer; otherwise, the flowfile will be routed to the
                        failure relationship. This value is ignored if the Rate Control
                        Criteria is not set to attribute value. Changing this value resets
                        the rate counters.</li>
                    <li>Default value: no default</li>
                    <li>Supports expression language: true.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Time Duration</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>The amount of time to which the Maximum Rate property
                        pertains. Changing this value resets the rate counters.</li>
                    <li>Default value: 1 min</li>
                    <li>Supports expression language: false.</li>
                </ul></li>
            <li>Grouping Attribute
                <ul>
                    <li>By default, a single "throttle" is used for all FlowFiles.
                        If this value is specified, a separate throttle is used for each
                        value specified by the attribute with this name. Changing this
                        value resets the rate counters.</li>
                    <li>Default value: no default</li>
                    <li>Supports expression language: true.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <strong>Relationships:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>success
                <ul>
                    <li>If FlowFiles are successfully processed, then they follow
                        this relationship.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
