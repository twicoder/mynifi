        <h2>Description:</h2>
        <p>This processor segments a FlowFile into multiple smaller segments on byte boundaries. Each segment is given attributes that can
            then be used by the MergeContent processor to reconstruct the original FlowFile.</p>

        <p>In the list below, the names of required properties appear
            in bold. Any other properties (not in bold) are considered optional.
            If a property has a default value, it is indicated. If a property
            supports the use of the NiFi Expression Language (or simply,
            "expression language"), that is also indicated.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Segment Size</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>The maximum data size for each segment. The value must be a
                        non-negative integer followed by a supported Data Unit, such as B,
                        KB, MB, GB, or TB. Example: 1 MB.</li>
                    <li>Default value: no default</li>
                    <li>Supports expression language: false</li>

                        was small enough that it was not segmented, then a copy of the
                        original is sent to this relationship as well as original.</li>
