        <!-- Processor Documentation ================================================== -->
        <h2>Description:</h2>
        <p>
            This processor writes FlowFiles to an HDFS cluster. It will create directories in which to store files as
            needed based on the <em>Directory</em> property.
        </p>

        <p>
            When files are written to HDFS, the file's owner is the user identity of the NiFi process, the file's group is the
            group of the parent directory, and the read/write/execute permissions use the default umask. The owner can be
            overridden using the <em>Remote Owner</em> property, the group can be overridden using the <em>Remote Group</em>
            property, and the read/write/execute permissions can be overridden using the <em>Permissions umask</em> property.
        </p>
        <p>NOTE: This processor can change owner or group only if the user identity of the NiFi process has super user
            privilege in HDFS to do so.</p>
        <p>
            NOTE: The <em>Permissions umask</em> property cannot add execute permissions to regular files.
        </p>

        <h2>Properties:</h2>
        <p>In the list below, the names of required properties appear in bold. Any other properties (not in bold) are
            considered optional. If a property has a default value, it is indicated. If a property supports the use of the
            NiFi Expression Language (or simply, "expression language"), that is also indicated.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Hadoop Configuration Resources
                <ul>
                    <li>A file or comma separated list of files which contains the Hadoop file system configuration.
                        Without this, Hadoop will search the classpath for a 'core-site.xml' and 'hdfs-site.xml' file or will
                        revert to a default configuration.</li>
                    <li>Default value: none</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Directory</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>The HDFS directory to which FlowFile content should be written. This property supports the
                        expression language so you can keep the FlowFile's directory structure by using the ${path} attribute
                        reference, e.g. /in/data/${path}.</li>
                    <li>Default value: none</li>
                    <li>Supports expression language: true</li>
                </ul></li>
            <li><strong>Conflict Resolution Strategy</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Indicates what should happen when a file with the same name already exists in the output directory.
                        Valid options are:</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>replace - existing file is overwritten by new file</li>
                        <li>ignore - existing file is untouched, FlowFile routed to success</li>
                        <li>fail - existing file is untouched, FlowFile routed to failure</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>Default value: fail</li>
                </ul></li>
            <li>Block Size
                <ul>
                    <li>Size of each block as written to HDFS. This is a data size integer that must include units of B,
                        KB, MB, GB, or TB. This overrides the Hadoop Configuration.</li>
                    <li>Default value: none</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>IO Buffer Size
                <ul>
                    <li>Amount of memory to use to buffer file contents during IO. This is a data size integer that must
                        include units of B, KB, MB, GB, or TB. This overrides the Hadoop Configuration.</li>
                    <li>Default value: none</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Replication
                <ul>
                    <li>Number of times that HDFS will replicate each file. This must be an integer greater than 0. This
                        overrides the Hadoop Configuration.</li>
                    <li>Default value: none</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Permissions umask
                <ul>
                    <li>A umask represented as an octal number which determines the permissions of files written to HDFS.
                        This overrides the Hadoop Configuration dfs.umaskmode.</li>
                    <li>Default value: none</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Remote Owner
                <ul>
                    <li>Changes the owner of the HDFS file to this value after it is written. This only works if NiFi is
                        running as a user that has HDFS super user privilege to change owner.</li>
                    <li>Default value: none</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Remote Group
                <ul>
                    <li>Changes the group of the HDFS file to this value after it is written. This only works if NiFi is
                        running as a user that has HDFS super user privilege to change group.</li>
                    <li>Default value: none</li>
                </ul>
