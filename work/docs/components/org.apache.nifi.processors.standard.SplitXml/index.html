        <h2>Description:</h2>
        <p>
            This processor splits an XML file into multiple separate FlowFiles, each comprising a child or descendant of the original root element.
        <p>

            <strong>Properties:</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            In the list below, the names of required properties appear in bold. Any other properties (not in bold) are considered optional. If a property has a default value, it is indicated. If a property supports the use of the NiFi Expression Language (or simply, "expression language"), that is also indicated.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Line Depth</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>The XML-nesting depth at which to start splitting the XML fragments. A depth of 1 means to split the root's children; whereas a depth of 2 means to split the root's children's children, and so forth.</li>
                    <li>Default value: 1</li>
                    <li>Supports expression language: false</li>
                </ul></li>

                <ul>
                    <li>If a FlowFile fails processing for any reason (for example, if the FlowFile is not valid XML), then it follows this relationship and does not go down the original relationship.</li>

                <ul>
