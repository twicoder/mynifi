        <!-- Processor Documentation ================================================== -->
        <h2>Description:</h2>
        <p>This processor scans the content of FlowFiles for terms that
            are found in a user-supplied dictionary file. If a term is matched,
            the UTF-8 encoded version of the term is added to the FlowFile using
            the matching.term attribute. This allows for follow-on processors to
            use the value of the matching.term attribute to make routing decisions
            and so forth.
        </p>

        </p>
        <p>In the list below, the names of required properties appear
            in bold. Any other properties (not in bold) are considered optional.
            If a property has a default value, it is indicated. If a property
            supports the use of the NiFi Expression Language (or simply,
            "expression language"), that is also indicated.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Dictionary File</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>The local file path and filename for the dictionary file.</li>
                    <li>Default value: no default</li>
                    <li>Supports expression language: false</li>
                </ul></li>
            <li><strong>Dictionary Encoding</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Indicates how the dictionary file is encoded. If the
                        default value text is used, the dictionary terms are expected to be
                        new-line delimited and UTF-8 encoded. If the value binary is used,
                        the dictionary terms are expected to be denoted by a 4-byte integer
                        indicating the term length, followed by the term itself.</li>
                    <li>Default value: text</li>
                    <li>Supports expression language: false</li>

            <li>matched
                <ul>
                    <li>If FlowFiles match at least one term in the dictionary
                        file, then they follow this relationship.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>If FlowFiles do not match any term in the dictionary file,
                        then they follow this relationship.</li>
