        <h2>Description:</h2>
        <p>This processor detects duplicate data by examining flow file attributes,
            thus allowing the user to configure what it means for two FlowFiles to be 
            considered "duplicates". This processor does not read the contents of a 
            flow file, and is typically preceded by another processor which computes a
            value based on the flow file content and adds that value to the flow file's 
            attributes; e.g. HashContent. Because this Processor needs to be able 
            to work within a NiFi cluster, it makes use of a distributed cache service to
            determine whether or not the data has been seen previously.</p>

        <p>
            If the processor is to be run on a standalone instance of
            NiFi, that instance should have both a
            DistributedMapCacheClient and a DistributedMapCacheServer configured
            in its controller-services.xml file.

                        The value of this attribute is determined by the attributes of the

            If a property has a default value, it is indicated. If a property
            supports the use of the NiFi Expression Language (or simply,

                        identify duplicates; it is this value that is cached</li>
                    <li>Default value: ${hash.value}</li>

                        the original FlowFile will be added to the duplicate's
                        "original.flowfile.description" attribute</li>
