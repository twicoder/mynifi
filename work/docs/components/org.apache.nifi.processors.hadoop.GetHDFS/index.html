        <h2>Description:</h2>
        <p>This processor reads files from an HDFS cluster into NiFi FlowFiles.</p>

        <p>
            <strong>Modifies Attributes:</strong>
        </p>
        <table border="1">
            <thead>
                <tr>
                    <th>Attribute Name</th>
                    <th>Description</th>

                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>path</td>
                    <td>The path is set to the relative path of the file's directory on HDFS. For example, if the <em>Directory</em>
                        property is set to <code>/tmp</code>, then files picked up from /tmp will have the path attribute set to
                        &quot;<code>./</code>&quot;. If the <em>Recurse Subdirectories</em> property is set to <code>true</code>
                        and a file is picked up from /tmp/abc/1/2/3, then the path attribute will be set to &quot;<code>abc/1/2/3</code>&quot;.

        <p>In the list below, the names of required properties appear in bold. Any other properties (not in bold) are
            considered optional. If a property has a default value, it is indicated. If a property supports the use of the

                <ul>
                    <li>A file or comma separated list of files which contains the Hadoop file system configuration.
                        Without this, Hadoop will search the classpath for a 'core-site.xml' and 'hdfs-site.xml' file or will
                        revert to a default configuration.</li>

            <li><strong>Recurse Subdirectories</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>A Boolean value (true/false), when true will pull files from subdirectories of the HDFS <em>Directory</em>.
                    </li>
                    <li>Default value: true</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>A Boolean value (true/false), indicates whether to keep (true) or delete (false) the file from HDFS
                        after it has been successfully transferred.</li>
                    <li>Default value: false</li>

            <li>File Filter Regex
                <ul>
                    <li>A Java Regular Expression for filtering Filenames; if a filter is supplied then only files whose
                        names match that Regular Expression will be fetched, otherwise all files will be fetched.</li>
                    <li>Default value: none</li>

            <li><strong>Filter Match Name Only</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>A Boolean value (true/false), when true <em>File Filter Regex</em> will match on just the filename,
                        otherwise subdirectory names will be included with filename in the regex comparison.
                    </li>
                    <li>Default value: true</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>A Boolean value (true/false), when true files whose names begin with a dot (&quot;.&quot;) will not
                        be fetched.</li>
                    <li>Default value: true</li>
                </ul></li>
            <li><strong>Minimum File Age</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>The minimum age that a file must be in order to be fetched; any file that is younger than this
                        amount of time (based on last modification time) will be ignored. The value must be a non-negative
                        integer and be followed by a time unit, such as nanos, millis, secs, mins, hrs, days.</li>
                    <li>Default value: 0 sec</li>

            <li>Maximum File Age
                <ul>
                    <li>The maximum age that a file must be in order to be fetched; any file that is older than this amount
                        of time (based on last modification time) will be ignored. The value must be a non-negative integer,
                        followed by a time unit, such as nanos, millis, secs, mins, hrs, days. Cannot be less than 100 millis.</li>
                    <li>Default value: none</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Polling Interval</strong>
                <ul>

                    <li>Default value: 0 sec</li>
                </ul></li>
            <li><strong>Batch Size</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>The maximum number of files to pull in each iteration, based on configured run schedule.</li>
                    <li>Default value: 100</li>
                </ul></li>
            <li>IO Buffer Size
                <ul>
                    <li>Amount of memory to use to buffer file contents during IO. This is a data size integer that must
                        include units of B, KB, MB, GB, or TB. This overrides the Hadoop Configuration.</li>
                    <li>Default value: none</li>
