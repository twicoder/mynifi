        <h2>Description:</h2>
        <p>
            This processor transforms the contents of FlowFiles based on a user-specified XSLT stylesheet file. XSL versions 1.0 and 2.0 are supported.
        <p>

            <strong>Properties:</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            In the list below, the names of required properties appear in bold. Any other properties (not in bold) are considered optional. If a property has a default value, it is indicated. If a property supports the use of the NiFi Expression Language (or simply, "expression language"), that is also indicated.

        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>XSLT File</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>The local file path to the XLST file to be used for transformation.</li>
                    <li>Default value: no default</li>
                    <li>Supports expression language: false</li>
                </ul></li>
        </ul>

        Note that this processor passes all dynamic properties to the transformer, so therefore they will be available for use in the stylesheet.

        <p>
            <strong>Relationships:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>success
                <ul>
                    <li>If the FlowFile content is successfully transformed by the XSLT transformer, then the FlowFile follows this relationship.</li>
                </ul></li>	
            <li>failure
                <ul>
                    <li>If the FlowFiles content fails to be transformed by the XSLT transformer, then the FlowFile follows this relationship.</li>
                </ul></li>	
        </ul>
