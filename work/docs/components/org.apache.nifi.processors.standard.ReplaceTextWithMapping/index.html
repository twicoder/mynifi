        <!-- Processor Documentation ================================================== -->
        <h2>Description:</h2>
        <p>
            This processor updates the content of a FlowFile by evaluating a
            regular
            expression (regex) against the content and replacing the section of
            content that matches a specified matching&nbsp; group of the
            regular expression with an alternate,
            user-defined, value provided in a mapping file. &nbsp;The mapping
            file is formatted as one key/value pair per line, seperated by tabs.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Properties:</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            In the list below, the names of required properties appear in bold.
            Any other properties (not in bold) are considered optional. If a
            property has a default value, it is indicated. If a property supports
            the use of the NiFi Expression Language (or simply, "expression
            language"), that is also indicated.

                <ul>
                    <li>The regular expression to use to evaluate the FlowFile

                        the mapping file.</li>
                    <li>Default value: 60s</li>

                        file) in order to apply the regular expression. If a FlowFile is larger
                        than this value, then the FlowFile is routed to the failure
                        relationship.</li>
