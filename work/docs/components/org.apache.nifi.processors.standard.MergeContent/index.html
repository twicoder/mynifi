        <h2>Description:</h2>
        <p>This processor merges a group of FlowFiles together into a
            "Bundle" based on a user-defined strategy and packages them into a
            single FlowFile. It is recommended that the processor be configured
            with only a single incoming connection, as groups of FlowFiles will
            not be created from FlowFiles in different connections. This processor
            updates the mime.type attribute as appropriate. After files have been merged by this processor, they can be
            unpackaged later using the UnpackContent processor.</p>

        </p>
        <p>In the list below, the names of required properties appear
            in bold. Any other properties (not in bold) are considered optional.
            If a property has a default value, it is indicated. If a property
            supports the use of the NiFi Expression Language (or simply,
            "expression language"), that is also indicated.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Merge Strategy</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Specifies the algorithm used to merge content. The
                        following Merge Strategies are available:
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>Bin-Packing Algorithm</b> - This strategy uses the
                                &lt;Minimum Number of Entries&gt; and &lt;Maximum Number of
                                Entries&gt; properties to determine how many FlowFiles should be
                                used to create a Bundle.</li>
                            <li><b>Defragment</b> - This strategy is used when
                                recombining a set of FlowFiles that have been broken apart
                                previously. When using this value, the &lt;Minimum Number of
                                Entries&gt; and &lt;Maximum Number of Entries&gt; properties are
                                ignored. In lieu of using these properties, the pocessor
                                determines the number of FlowFiles to use for a bundle by
                                examining the <code>fragment.count</code> attribute of the
                                FlowFiles.</li>

                    </li>
                    <li>Default value: Bin-Packing Algorithm</li>
                    <li>Supports expression language: false</li>
                </ul></li>
            <li><strong>Merge Format</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Determines the format that will be used to merge the
                        content. Options include the following values:
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>Binary Concatenation</b> - FlowFiles will be combined
                                by concatenating their content. The ordering of the FlowFiles is
                                non-deterministic.</li>

                            <li><b>TAR</b> - FlowFiles will be combined by creating a TAR
                                file. If the &lt;Keep Path&gt; property is set to <code>true</code>,
                                the FlowFiles' paths will determine the folder in the TAR file
                                where the FlowFile's content will be stored. Otherwise, all
                                FlowFiles' content will be stored in the TAR file's root
                                directory. If a FlowFile that is to be bundled has an attribute
                                with the name <code>tar.permissions</code> and that attribute's
                                value is a 3-digit number (with each number in the range of 0-7),
                                the value will be applied as the File Permissions for that TAR
                                entry.</li>

                            <li><b>ZIP</b> - FlowFiles will be combined by creating a ZIP
                                file. If the &lt;Keep Path&gt; property is set to <code>true</code>,
                                the FlowFiles' paths will determine the folder in the ZIP file
                                where the FlowFile's content will be stored. Otherwise, all
                                FlowFiles' content will be stored in the ZIP file's root
                                directory. The &lt;Compression Level&gt; property can be used to
                                determine the Compression Level to use, from 0 (no compression)
                                to 9 (highest compression).</li>

                            <li><b>FlowFileStream, v3</b> - This format would be used if the merged files
                                are to be sent to another NiFi system that is running NiFi version 3.0 or later.
                                When this format is selected, FlowFiles will be combined
                                into a FlowFileStream, which includes both FlowFile Attributes
                                and Content for all FlowFiles.</li>

                            <li><b>FlowFileStream, v2</b> - This format would be used if the merged files
                                are to be sent to another NiFi system that is running a NiFi version older than NiFi-3.0.
                                When this format is selected, FlowFiles will be combined
                                into a FlowFileStream, which includes both FlowFile Attributes
                                and Content for all FlowFiles. Only use this if required for backward compatibility.</li>

                            <li><b>FlowFile Tar, v1</b> - This format would be used if the merged files
                                are to be sent to another NiFi system that is running a much older NiFi version that does not support a FlowFileStream.
                                When this format is selected, FlowFiles will be combined
                                into a FlowFile Tar, which includes both FlowFile Attributes
                                and Content for all FlowFiles. Only use this if required for backward compatibility.</li>

                    <li>Determines which FlowFile attributes should be added to

                        attribute on any FlowFile that gets bundled will be kept unless
                        its value conflicts with the value from another FlowFile. If
                        'Keep Only Common Attributes' is selected, only the attributes
                        that exist on all FlowFiles in the bundle with the same value
                        will be preserved.</li>

                        then the fragment.identifier attribute is automatically used. Otherwise,
