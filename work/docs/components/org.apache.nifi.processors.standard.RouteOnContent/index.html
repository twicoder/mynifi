        <h2>Description:</h2>
        <p>
            This processor applies user-added regular expressions to the content of a FlowFile and routes a copy of the FlowFile to each destination whose regular expression matches. The user adds properties where the name is the relationship that the FlowFile should follow if it matches the regular expression, which is defined as the property's value. User-defined properties do support the NiFi Expression Language, but in such cases, the results are interpreted as literal values, not regular expressions.
        <p>

            <strong>Properties:</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            In the list below, the names of required properties appear in bold. Any other properties (not in bold) are considered optional. If a property has a default value, it is indicated. If a property supports the use of the NiFi Expression Language (or simply, "expression language"), that is also indicated.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Match Requirement</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Specifies whether the entire content of the FlowFile must match the regular expression exactly, or if any part of the content (up to a certain point) can contain the regular expression in order to be considered a match. Available options:
                        <ul>
                            <li>content must match exactly</li>
                            <li>content must contain match</li>
                        </ul></li>
                    <li>Default value: content must match exactly</li>
                    <li>Supports expression language: false</li>
                </ul></li>
            <li><strong>Character Set</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>The character set in which the file is encoded.</li>
                    <li>Default value: UTF-8</li>
                    <li>Supports expression language: false</li>
                </ul></li>
            <li><strong>Content Buffer Size</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Specifies the maximum amount of data to buffer in order to apply the regular expressions. If the size of the FlowFile exceeds this value, any amount of this value is ignored. </li>
                    <li>Default value: 1 MB</li>
                    <li>Supports expression language: false</li>
                </ul></li>
            <li>User-Defined Properties
                <ul>
                    <li>Users add properties with regular expressions (see the description above).</li>
                    <li>User-defined properties do support the NiFi Expression Language, but in such cases, the results are interpreted as literal values, not regular expressions.</li>
                </ul></li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            <strong>Relationships:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>unmatched
                <ul>
                    <li>FlowFiles that do not match any user-defined criteria follow this relationship.</li>
                </ul></li>
            <li>user-defined relationships
                <ul>
                    <li>User-added properties result in new relationships; if a FlowFile's content matches the criteria specified in the user-added properties, then it follows the associated relationship(s).</li>
                </ul></li>
        </ul>
